# STL files  
STL files used for the project. They include:  
- a custom set of 5:1 gears for the shaft of the motor, and the shaft of the coffee grinder; 
- and a custom chassis for the coffee grinder, to add space for a battery pack, motor, and the manual coffee grinder itself.  

I've also added different versions of the chassis so you can see my troubleshooting skills & progress I've made. Although changes were minor (usually had to do with extrusion directions/lengths), they were definitely important as the chassis is quite complex and has a small margin of error.
