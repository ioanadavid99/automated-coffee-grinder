# master-and-slave  
The purpose of this directory is for code to interface an NodeMCU (master) with an Arduino Uno (slave) using I2C communication protocols. Currently the code being used is open-sourced; however, it will be modified in order for the NodeMCU to send commands to the Arduino Uno and to listen to the data being retrieved.
