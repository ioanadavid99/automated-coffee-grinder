# master & slave  
## current work  
The purpose of this directory is for code to interface an NodeMCU (master) with an Arduino Uno (slave) using I2C communication protocols. Currently the code being used is open-sourced; however, it will be modified in order for the NodeMCU to send commands to the Arduino Uno and to listen to the data being retrieved.  

## future work  
I will be using two NodeMCUs to interface with each other as a client/server in order to develop this communication using IoT. The goal is to be able to interface with a kitchen scale wirelessly, possibly through simple web/mobile apps as opposed to using the Arduino IDE.
