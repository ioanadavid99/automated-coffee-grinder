# working-code
This repo contains working code for putting together ALL the features as discussed on the landing page of this repository. They will be well-commented but for now, they are a work in progress. See [deep-sleep](https://github.com/ioanadavid99/automatized-coffee-grinder/tree/master/deep-sleep) for an idea of the workflow (which includes a diagram for those of us who hate looking at things linearly). 

Credit is given to authors of tutorials and/or code in ```arduino-working-code```.
