# automatized-coffee-grinder
Personal project - automated a manual coffee grinder.

Currently using AutoDesk Inventor to CAD a custom chassis and custom 5:1 gears to improve the torque of the motor. 
Will work on integrating Arduino with a basic kitchen scale to implement mass-reading capabilities.

The goal is to create a completely automated coffee grinder where you can set your desired grind type and size, and complete this autonomously.
